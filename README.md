 # AutoMCQ

I had way too much time to kill on my hands.

Feed it an xlsx file. Magic happens. Your MCQ is now filled with random 
answers.

Depends on openpyxl. Everything else should be part of Python's standard library.

**Installation**

Linux: sudo make install  
Windows: Download [this](https://github.com/bad64/automcq/releases/download/v1.0/automcq.exe), put it basically wherever you want, add that destination to %PATH% if you *really* want to

**Why Python ?**

Didn't find a library to do it in C/C++.
